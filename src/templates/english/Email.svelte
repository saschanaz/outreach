  Hello, <br /><br /> Hope it's OK I'm reaching out, I am an engineer working on
  Mozilla Firefox.<br /> A user reported an issue with
  {@html url}
  not working properly in Mozilla Firefox.<br /><br /> We’ve diagnosed the website
  issue and I’m reaching out in hopes of passing along the information to resolve
  it. More information is available in our bug report:
  {@html bugUrl}
  <br /><br /> Might you be able to pass this along to the relevant person or team
  to be looked at? <br /><br /> Thanks for your time,<br />
